# DataEngineering-Project-API-Pandas-AWS-lambda-Glue-Athena-
This project retrieves semi-structured JSON data from an API, structures it with Pandas, and processes it via AWS Glue to create data catalog tables. Amazon Athena queries these tables for analysis. Initially built locally, AWS Lambda enables similar cloud-based functionality.
