# DataEngineering-Project-API-Pandas-AWS-lambda-Glue-Athena-
This project focuses on retrieving semi-structured JSON data from an API and transforming it into a structured format using the Pandas library. The structured data is then processed using AWS Glue to create data catalog tables. Finally, Amazon Athena is employed to query the data catalog tables, providing a relational table-like experience for data analysis. The project is first built locally then we use AWS Lambda to transform similar functionality over cloud.
